This affects the slip behavior of individual ruptures, as well as the seismicity patterns. Our goal is to understand how fault roughness affects seismic sequences.\nWe have been exploring this question with quasi-dynamic rate-state simulations. The effect of roughness is easily understood in terms of normal stress variations, as follows. Slip on a rough fault generates regions of compressive stresses, which are stronger and tend to act as seismic asperities: they are locked between earthquakes, and once they accelerate they break in fast (seismic) events. Other regions experience tensile stress perturbations due to slip, and these weaker regions tend to slip in a stable matter (creep). Foreshock sequences are controlled by the stress transfer between these two regions, and several observed features (such as the temporal evolution of foreshocks and their tendency to migrate) arise naturally from these interactions.\nIn future work we will explore how a rough fault responds to external stress perturbations such as those from regional and remote earthquakes or anthropogenic activites (e.g. fluid injection).

Why do we see such different behaviors?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been addressing this question from the prospective of fracture mechanics, connecting fault physics at a microscopic scale with the timing and extent of earthquake ruptures. Energy balance criteria predict that the timing and size of seismic events is controlled by the dimension of a fault relative to a characteristic length arising from frictional and elastic properties; for sufficiently large faults, this leads to power-law distributions commonly observed in earthquake catalogs. On the other hand, small faults can rupture in simple, quasi-periodic sequences of identical events. We have depeloped theoretical arguments predicting the recurrence intervals and its scaling with magnitude, in agreement with observations of small repeating earthquakes worldwide.\nUntil now, we have considered a rather idealized fault geometry and spatial distribution of frictional properties. Current and future work explores more complex and realistic cases, with applications to subduction zone cyles.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"5e16d66c7eb4b50b9fd5cb85fbc15609","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/camcat/project/eq-cycles/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/camcat/project/eq-cycles/","section":"project","summary":"How statistical properties of seismicity emerge from fracture mechanics","tags":null,"title":"Fault mechanics and earthquake cycles","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Small repeating earthquakes are events characterized by very similar waveforms, and overlapping rupture areas. Unlike most other earthquakes, they are very periodic; they are commonly interpreted as rupturing an isolated asperity embedded in a velocity-strengthening (creeping) fault. Since they are driven by aseismic slip, they are an invaluable tool to probe creeping sections of a fault, and detect spatio-temporal variations in slip rate. I used simple crack models to derive analytical expressions for the recurrence interval as a function of asperity dimension and seismic moment. These expressions are in excellent agreement with the scaling between recurrence interval and seismic moment observed in the simulations: $T_r \\sim M_0^{1/ 6}$ (see figure), consistent with observations.\nWhile these results are based on a relatively simple model (circular, uniform asperities), they provide a useful framework to interpret the seismic behavior of small asperities. They make specific predictions, such as a dependence of stress drop on magnitude and a transition between central ruptures for small asperities to lateral ruptures for large asperities (where small and large is a well defined ratio between the asperitity radius and the nucleation radius); similarly, the occurrence of partial ruptures is expected for asperities exceeding a particular dimension.\nCattania, C. and P. Segall (2018), Crack models of repeating earthquakes predict observed moment-recurrence scaling, J. Geophys. Res. Solid Earth ( abstract; article)\n Current and future efforts: The results above imply a break of self-similarity near the nucleation dimension. Could this be seen in the data? To answer this question, we first need a theoretical source model for small earthquakes, which does not assume constant rupture velocity but instead considers the initial acceleration.

A primary mechanism for aftershocks is the static deformation and stresses in vicinity of a mainshock. Physics-based models for Operational Earthquake Forecasting bring our physical knowledge of elasticity and friction into time-dependent, probabilistic earthquake forecasts.\nOur approach has been guided by an attempt to construct physically consistent and realistic models of the processes involved, by including time-dependent (aseismic) fault slip and a realistic fault geometry. We found that deep afterslip following large subduction earthquakes significantly contributes to triggering seismicity on shallow crustal faults ( Cattania et al, 2015). Another outcome of this work is that stress heterogeneity due to the geometrical complexity of a fault system has a first-order impact in model behavior ( Cattania et al, 2014), and it significantly improves performance. This improvement was confirmed by a collaborative experiment carried out within CSEP for the aftershock sequence of the 2010 Canterbury (New Zealand) earthquake ( Cattania et al., 2018). In a collaboration with Simone Mancini (British Geological Survey/University of Bristol), Margarita Segou (BGS) and Max Werner (Univeristy of Bristol) we have further improved and tested these models, in the context of the 2016-2017 sequence in the Central Appennines (Italy).\nExternal links: International collaboration studies the predictability of earthquakes on phys.org\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"acfccece3c6501b537b55319213535a8","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/camcat/project/eof/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/camcat/project/eof/","section":"project","summary":"Aftershock sequences take place after all moderate and large earthquakes, and are a significant source of hazard.

Two interpretations have been advanced: (1) foreshocks are driven by aseismic nucleation and (2) foreshocks are cascades, with each event triggered by earlier ones. Here, we study seismic cycles on faults with fractal roughness at wavelengths exceeding the nucleation length. We perform 2-D quasi-dynamic, elastic simulations of frictionally uniform rate-state faults. Roughness leads to a range of slip behavior between system-size ruptures, including widespread creep, localized slow slip, and microseismicity. These processes are explained by spatial variations in normal stress ($σ$) caused by roughness: regions with low $σ$ tend to creep, while high $σ$ regions remain locked until they break seismically. Foreshocks and mainshocks both initiate from the rupture of locked asperities, but mainshocks preferentially start on stronger asperities. The preseismic phase is characterized by feedback between creep and foreshocks: episodic seismic bursts break groups of nearby asperities, causing creep to accelerate, which in turns loads other asperities leading to further foreshocks. A simple analytical treatment of this mutual stress transfer, confirmed by simulations, predicts slip velocities and seismicity rates increase as 1/t, where t is the time to the mainshock. The model reproduces the observed migration of foreshocks toward the mainshock hypocenter, foreshock locations consistent with static stress changes, and the 1/t acceleration in stacked catalogs. Instead of interpreting foreshocks as either driven by coseismic stress changes or by creep, we propose that earthquake nucleation on rough faults is driven by the feedback between the two.","tags":["earthquake nucleation","fault roughness","foreshocks"],"title":"Precursory Slow Slip and Foreshocks on Rough Faults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brittany A.

However, significant challenges in SEAS modeling remain in resolving multiscale interactions between earthquake nucleation, dynamic rupture, and aseismic slip, and understanding physical factors controlling observables such as seismicity and ground deformation. The increasing complexity of SEAS modeling calls for extensive efforts to verify codes and advance these simulations with rigor, reproducibility, and broadened impact. In 2018, we initiated a community code-verification exercise for SEAS simulations, supported by the Southern California Earthquake Center. Here, we report the findings from our first two benchmark problems (BP1 and BP2), designed to verify different computational methods in solving a mathematically well-defined, basic faulting problem. We consider a 2D antiplane problem, with a 1D planar vertical strike-slip fault obeying rate-and-state friction, embedded in a 2D homogeneous, linear elastic half-space. Sequences of quasi-dynamic earthquakes with periodic occurrences (BP1) or bimodal sizes (BP2) and their interactions with aseismic slip are simulated. The comparison of results from 11 groups using different numerical methods show excellent agreements in long-term and coseismic fault behavior. In BP1, we found that truncated domain boundaries influence interseismic stressing, earthquake recurrence, and coseismic rupture, and that model agreement is only achieved with sufficiently large domain sizes. In BP2, we found that complexity of fault behavior depends on how well physical length scales related to spontaneous nucleation and rupture propagation are resolved. Poor numerical resolution can result in artificial complexity, impacting simulation results that are of potential interest for characterizing seismic hazard such as earthquake size distributions, moment release, and recurrence times. These results inform the development of more advanced SEAS models, contributing to our further understanding of earthquake system dynamics.","tags":["rate-state friction","earthquake cycle","model validation"],"title":"The Community Code Verification Exercise for Simulating Sequences of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip (SEAS)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Continuum fault models without heterogeneity typically produce characteristic earthquakes or a narrow range of sizes, leading to the view that regional statistics originate from interaction of multiple faults. I present theoretical arguments and numerical simulations demonstrating that seismicity on homogeneous planar faults can span several orders of magnitude in rupture dimensions and interevent times, if the fault dimension W is sufficiently large compared to a characteristic length $L_ŗit$, related to the nucleation dimension. Large faults are increasingly less characteristic, with the fraction of system-size ruptures proportional to ($L_i̧t/W)̂1/ 2$. Earthquake statistics for large $W/L_cţ$ is remarkably close to nature, exhibiting Omori decay and power law distributed rupture lengths.

Recent studies reveal that physics-based aftershock forecasts present comparable skills to their statistical counterparts, but their performance remains a controversial subject. Here we employ physics-based models that combine the elasto-static stress transfer with rate-and-state friction laws, and short-term statistical Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) models to describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the earthquake cascade. We then track the absolute and relative model performance using log-likelihood statistics for a 1-year horizon after the 24 August 2016 Mw = 6.0 Amatrice earthquake. We perform a series of pseudoprospective experiments by producing seven classes of Coulomb rate-state (CRS) forecasts with gradual increase in data input quality and model complexity. Our goal is to investigate the influence of data quality on the predictive power of physics-based models and to assess the comparative performance of the forecasts in critical time windows, such as the period following the 26 October Visso earthquakes leading to the 30 October Mw = 6.5 Norcia mainshock. We find that (1) the spatiotemporal performance of the basic CRS models is poor and progressively improves as more refined data are used, (2) CRS forecasts are about as informative as ETAS when secondary triggering effects from M3+ earthquakes are included together with spatially variable slip models, spatially heterogeneous receiver faults, and optimized rate-and-state parameters. After the Visso earthquakes, the more elaborate CRS model outperforms ETAS highlighting the importance of the static stress transfer for operational earthquake forecasting.","tags":["aftershocks","Coulomb stress changes","ETAS model","earthquake forecasting","triggering"],"title":"Improving Physics-Based Aftershock Forecasts during the 2016– 2017 Central Italy Earthquake Cascade","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Camilla Cattania","Maximilian J.

However, the forecast skill of coulomb-based seismicity models remains controversial, especially compared with empirical statistical models. A previous evaluation by the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) concluded that a suite of coulomb-based seismicity models were less informative than empirical models during the aftershock sequence of the 1992 M w 7.3 Landers, California, earthquake. Recently, a new generation of coulomb-based and coulomb/statistical hybrid models were developed that account better for uncertainties and secondary stress sources. Here, we report on the performance of this new suite of models compared with empirical epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) models during the 2010– 2012 Canterbury, New Zealand, earthquake sequence. Comprising the 2010 M7.1 Darfield earthquake and three subsequent M$≥$ 5.9 shocks (including the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake), this sequence provides a wealth of data (394 M $≥$ 3.95 shocks). We assessed models over multiple forecast horizons (1 day, 1 month, and 1 yr, updated after M $≥$ 5.9 shocks). The results demonstrate substantial improvements in the coulomb-based models. Purely physics-based models have a performance comparable to the ETAS model, and the two coulomb/statistical hybrids perform better or similar to the corresponding statistical model. On the other hand, an ETAS model with anisotropic (fault-based) aftershock zones is just as informative. These results provide encouraging evidence for the predictive power of coulomb-based models. To assist with model development, we identify discrepancies between forecasts and observations.","tags":["Coulomb stress changes","earthquake forecasting","triggering","aftershocks","ETAS","Canterbury","statistics"],"title":"The Forecasting Skill of Physics-based Seismicity Models during the 2010–2012 Canterbury, New Zealand, Earthquake Sequence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Camilla Cattania","Eleonora Rivalta","Sebastian Hainzl","Luigi Passarelli","Yosuke Aoki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"94e7a857fc8f57a3778fd99105998cfe","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/camcat/publication/cattania-2017-d/","publishdate":"2020-07-30T20:14:29.720898Z","relpermalink":"/camcat/publication/cattania-2017-d/","section":"publication","summary":"Magmatic intrusions release extensional strain in the Earth's crust upon availability of magma. Intrusions are typically accompanied by earthquake swarms and by surface faulting that is often larger than what is expected from the magnitude of the induced earthquakes. The 2000 Miyakejima dike intrusion triggered the largest volcanic earthquake swarm monitored so far, with five Ml $$ 6 earthquakes. We analyze the seismicity and deformation induced by the Miyakejima dike with the aim of constraining the timescale and mechanisms of slow strain release during the episode. In six earthquake bursts lasting few hours and migrating at $∼$1~km~h -1 we find candidates for slow earthquakes. Each burst nucleated at the tips of previous bursts, suggesting stress interaction. The variability of fault plane solutions indicates that the bursts occurred on a complex system of fractures, consistent with weakly consolidated surface layers strained by spatially inhomogneous stresses that change in time, such as those induced by a dike. Based on dislocation models, we find that deformation is best explained by aseismic slip (in addition to the seismic burst), with a moment 1.3 to 2.3 times larger than the earthquakes' seismic moment, and opening of 0.20 $±$ 0.07~m on the dike. The aseismic slip occurred over a few hours, with moment, duration, and migration velocit y consistent with that of previously observed slow slip events. We argue that the seismic bursts are likely driven by slow slip, sharing most properties with tectonic slow slip events and swarms, but occurring on a set of nonaligned faults.","tags":["dike","Miyakejima","slow slip","triggering","Japan","clustering"],"title":"A Nonplanar Slow Rupture Episode during the 2000 Miyakejima Dike Intrusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred F.

Static stress transfer to surrounding faults has been well documented to alter regional seismicity rates over both short and long time scales. While static stress transfer is instantaneous and long lived, postseismic stress transfer driven by viscoelastic relaxation of the ductile lower crust and mantle leads to additional, slowly varying stress perturbations. Both processes may be tested by comparing a decade-long record of regional seismicity to predicted time-dependent seismicity rates based on a stress evolution model that includes viscoelastic stress transfer. Here we explore crustal stress evolution arising from the seismic cycle in Southern California from 1981 to 2014 using five M$≥$6.5 source quakes: the M7.3 1992 Landers, M6.5 1992 Big Bear, M6.7 1994 Big Bear, M7.1 1999 Hector Mine, and M7.2 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquakes. We relate the stress readjustment in the surrounding crust generated by each quake to regional seismicity using rate-and-state friction theory. Using a log likelihood approach, we quantify the potential to trigger seismicity of both static and viscoelastic stress transfer, finding that both processes have systematically shaped the spatial pattern of Southern California seismicity since 1992.","tags":["earthquake triggering","viscoelasticity","Coulomb stress changes"],"title":"Connecting Crustal Seismicity and Earthquake-Driven Stress Evolution in Southern California","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Camilla Cattania","Jeffrey J.

Oceanic transform faults share properties with continental geothermal areas known for dynamic triggering: high geothermal gradients, high seismicity rates, and frequent swarms. Here we study dynamic triggering along the East Pacific Rise by analyzing one year of seismicity recorded by Ocean Bottom Seismographs. By comparing the response to teleseismic waves from global earthquakes, we find triggering to be most sensitive to changes in normal stress, and to preferentially occur above 0.25 kPa. The clearest example of triggering occurs on the Quebrada and Gofar faults after the M w 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake. On Gofar, triggered seismicity occurs between the rupture areas of large earthquakes, within a zone characterized by aseismic slip, abundant microseismicity, frequent swarms and low Vp . We infer that lithological properties inhibiting rupture propagation, such as high porosity and fluid content, also favor dynamic triggering.","tags":["dynamic triggering","fault segmentation","transform","East Pacific Rise","statistics"],"title":"Dynamic Triggering and Earthquake Swarms on East Pacific Rise Transform Faults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Camilla Cattania","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

Physics based earthquake forecasting models compute time dependent earthquake rates based on Coulomb stress changes, coupled with seismicity evolution laws derived from rate-state friction. While early implementations of such models typically performed poorly compared to statistical models, recent studies indicate that significant performance improvements can be achieved by considering the spatial heterogeneity of the stress field and secondary sources of stress. However, the major drawback of these methods is a rapid increase in computational costs. Here we present a code to calculate seismicity induced by time dependent stress changes. An important feature of the code is the possibility to include aleatoric uncertainties due to the existence of multiple receiver faults and to the finite grid size, as well as epistemic uncertainties due to the choice of input slip model. To compensate for the growth in computational requirements, we have parallelized the code for shared memory systems (using OpenMP) and distributed memory systems (using MPI). Performance tests indicate that these parallelization strategies lead to a significant speedup for problems with different degrees of complexity, ranging from those which can be solved on standard multicore desktop computers, to those requiring a small cluster, to a large simulation that can be run using up to 1500 cores.","tags":["Coulomb stress changes","earthquake forecasting","parallel computing","rate-state friction","aftershocks","triggering","HPC"],"title":"A Parallel Code to Calculate Rate-State Seismicity Evolution Induced by Time Dependent, Heterogeneous Coulomb Stress Changes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Camilla Cattania","Sebastian Hainzl","Lifeng Wang","Frank Roth","Bogdan Enescu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"ab01c925d4faacf719bf421e7a0a998d","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/camcat/publication/cattania-2014/","publishdate":"2020-07-30T20:14:29.71904Z","relpermalink":"/camcat/publication/cattania-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Stress transfer between earthquakes is recognized as a fundamental mechanism governing aftershock sequences. A common approach to relate stress changes to seismicity rate changes is the rate-and-state constitutive law developed by Dieterich: these elements are the foundation of Coulomb-rate-and-state (CRS) models. Despite the successes of Coulomb hypothesis and of the rate-and-state formulation, such models perform worse than statistical models in an operational forecasting context: one reason is that Coulomb stress is subject to large uncertainties and intrinsic spatial heterogeneity. In this study, we characterize the uncertainties in Coulomb stress inherited from different physical quantities and assess their effect on CRS models. We use a Monte Carlo method and focus on the following aspects: the existence of multiple receiver faults; the stress heterogeneity within grid cells, due to their finite size; and errors inherited from the coseismic slip model. We study two well-recorded sequences from different tectonic settings: the Mw = 6.0 Parkfield and the M_w= 9.0 Tohoku earthquakes. We find that the existence of multiple receiver faults is the most important source of intrinsic stress heterogeneity, and CRS models perform significantly better when this variability is taken into account. The choice of slip model also generates large uncertainties. We construct an ensemble model based on published slip models and find that it outperforms individual models. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying sources of errors and quantifying confidence boundaries in the forecasts; moreover, we demonstrate that consideration of stress heterogeneity and epistemic uncertainty has the potential to improve the performance of operational forecasting models.","tags":["Coulomb stress changes","earthquake triggering","fault roughness","earthquake forecasting","slip models","aftershocks","Parkfield","Tohoku","clustering","Japan","statistics"],"title":"Propagation of Coulomb Stress Uncertainties in Physics-Based Aftershock Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Camilla Cattania","Sebastian Hainzl","Frank Roth","Lifeng Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"b86ae83930cceb0663407a24fa65f8dd","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/camcat/publication/cattania-2014-b/","publishdate":"2020-07-30T20:14:29.719994Z","relpermalink":"/camcat/publication/cattania-2014-b/","section":"publication","summary":"The spatiotemporal clustering of earthquakes is a feature of medium- and short-term seismicity, indicating that earthquakes interact. However, controversy exists about the physical mechanism behind aftershock triggering: static stress transfer and reloading by postseismic processes have been proposed as explanations. In this work, we use a Coulomb rate-and-state model to study the role of coseismic and postseismic stress changes on aftershocks and focus on two processes: creep on the main shock fault plane (afterslip) and secondary aftershock triggering by previous aftershocks. We model the seismic response to Coulomb stress changes using the Dieterich constitutive law and focus on two events: the Parkfield, Mw 6.0, and the Tohoku, Mw 9.0, earthquakes. We find that modeling secondary triggering systematically improves the maximum log likelihood fit of the sequences. The effect of afterslip is more subtle and difficult to assess for near-fault events, where model errors are largest. More robust conclusions can be drawn for off-fault aftershocks: following the Tohoku earthquake, afterslip promotes shallow crustal seismicity in the Fukushima region. Simple geometrical considerations indicate that afterslip-induced stress changes may have been significant on trench parallel crustal fault systems following several of the largest recorded subduction earthquakes. Moreover, the time dependence of afterslip strongly enhances its triggering potential: seismicity triggered by an instantaneous stress change decays more quickly than seismicity triggered by gradual loading, and as a result we find afterslip to be particularly important between few weeks and few months after the main shock.","tags":["afterslip","earthquake triggering","Coulomb stress changes","earthquake forecasting","aftershocks","Tohoku","Parkfield","Japan","clustering","postseismic","megathrust","subduction"],"title":"The Relationship between Afterslip and Aftershocks: A Study Based on Coulomb-Rate-and-State Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Hainzl","Y Ben-Zion","C Cattania","J Wassermann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"e1f8f93361c3d1332e1223790f0b8d8c","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/camcat/publication/hainzl-2013/","publishdate":"2020-07-30T20:14:29.724712Z","relpermalink":"/camcat/publication/hainzl-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Seismicity closely related to hydrological impacts has been observed in several locations worldwide, particularly in intraplate areas where tectonic stressing rates are small. The triggering mechanism is usually explained by a poroelastic response of the seismogenic crust to surface water flux, leading to pore pressure changes at depth. To explain the earthquake triggering in response of those small stress changes, however, the crust has to be near a critical state in which other transient processes might be significant. One of the prominent examples is at Mt. Hochstaufen in SE Germany, where seismicity is known to vary seasonally. A previous analysis showed that the seismicity in 2002 was highly correlated with model forecasts based on fluid diffusion and rate- and state-dependent frictional nucleation. Here we revisit this case by accounting additionally for poroelastic effects, as well as for thermoelastic and tidal stresses. We also test whether the model can explain the observations of the subsequent 8 years between 2003 and 2010. Our analysis confirms that rainfall is the dominant driving force in this region. The model not only fits the year 2002 activity very well but also provides with the same parameters a reasonable fit to the subsequent period, with a probability gain of about 4 per event in comparison to a time-independent Poisson model.","tags":["Coulomb stress changes","triggering","rainfall-induced seismicity","thermo-elastic effects","tidal triggering","rate-state friction"],"title":"Testing Atmospheric and Tidal Earthquake Triggering at Mt.
